# RG lab notebook (append-only)

## Entry 1 — 2026-07-18

Scope frozen per project plan v1. Decisions locked for phase E:
- Encoder: embedding-path encoder (frozen small transformer phrases gate-cleared
  content later; it is never a source of facts).
- Algebra: MAP per the substrate spec in CLAUDE.md — bipolar int8, D=8192
  (D=16384 comparison arm), bind = elementwise product (self-inverse),
  permute = np.roll, bundle = sign(sum) with seeded tie-break,
  record R = subj * permute(rel,1) * permute(obj,2).
- Primary hardware: PC / WSL2, CPU-only NumPy. Substrate being trivial on CPU
  is a design claim we are proving.

Rationale: fix the algebra and hardware envelope before E1 measurements so the
capacity curves feed the E2 load-normalised gate without a moving target.

Note: docs/rg-project-plan-v1.md was not present in the repo at scaffold time;
E1 spec and exit criteria taken from CLAUDE.md.

## Entry 2 — 2026-07-18

Built E1 substrate core:
- `substrate/map_ops.py`: Codebook (named bipolar int8 item vectors, seeded;
  cosine cleanup returning top-k (name, cos) — a = s1, m = s1 - s2), bind,
  permute, bundle (sign(sum), seeded coin on zero ties), encode_record,
  unbind_obj / unbind_subj / unbind_rel.
- `substrate/test_map_ops.py`: algebra invariants + E1 exit round-trip.
- `substrate/capacity_sweep.py`: exit criterion 2 → capacity_curves.csv.
- `substrate/test_write_timing.py`: exit criterion 3.

Seeds: tests use SEED=42 (round-trip codebooks 42/43/44, triple sampling 45,
bundle tie-break 46); sweep uses master seed 42 expanded via
np.random.SeedSequence.spawn (one child per k, 20 trial seeds each); timing
test seed 42. Reproduce everything from a clean checkout with:
`python -m pytest substrate/ -s && python substrate/capacity_sweep.py --seed 42`

Results (D=8192, rel pool 10):
- Round-trip (criterion 1): 50/50 correct. a mean 0.112, min 0.088; m mean
  0.083, min 0.055. PASS.
- Capacity (criterion 2, obj pool 500): accuracy 1.000 through k=100, 0.9725
  at k=200, then falls off a cliff — 0.776 at k=350 (first sampled k below
  0.95), 0.569 at k=500.
- Hit-vs-miss Cohen's d on a: 24.4 (k=10), 15.5 (k=25), 9.7 (k=50), 5.7
  (k=100), 2.8 (k=200), 1.5 (k=350), 0.96 (k=500).
- O(1) write (criterion 3): 3-4 us/append, max/min ratio 1.45 across
  k in {10, 1e3, 1e4, 5e4}. Flat. PASS.

Surprises / notes:
- a_miss is strikingly load-invariant: mean ~0.0335, sd ~0.004 at every k.
  The ignorance floor doesn't move; separation degrades only because a_hit
  sinks toward it (~1/sqrt(k) attenuation from bundling). So mu/sigma for the
  E2 gate only needs the hit-side curve as a function of load — the miss side
  is a fixed property of (D, codebook size).
- d(a) stays > 2.7 while accuracy is still >= 0.97 (k <= 200), i.e. resolution
  geometry cleanly carries the hit/miss (ignorance) signal across the whole
  usable operating range. But d < 1 at k=500: past saturation, raw a cannot
  carry the gate — load normalisation in E2 is mandatory, not optional.
- sd(a_hit) is roughly constant (~0.011) until saturation, then shrinks; the
  signal loss is a mean effect, not a variance explosion.
