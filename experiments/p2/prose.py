"""Is a chat turn prose, or pasted code/terminal output?

Moved out of run_belief.py (2026-10-02). The product read/write path needed
only this helper, but importing it from run_belief also imported eight
research modules and, at import time, READ a gitignored research cache
(experiments/p2/extract_cache.jsonl) and opened it for APPENDING. A fresh
clone has no such file, so the server crashed on its first ingest -- the
new-user install test hit exactly that. run_belief re-exports it, so every
existing import keeps working.
